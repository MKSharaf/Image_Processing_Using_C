## Introduction
This was my solution for the **CSE 455** from Washington University, It is a course that covers the topic of CV starting from how a pixel value is set or obtained, all the way to 3D domain and advanced AI models. The tasks were to make a library's algorithms from scratch.

## What to expect
Those are the solutions to the Image Proccesing parts of the course, in this you will find implementations for many algorithms starting from a simple get pixel, and all the way to Lucas-Kanade optical flow, and Panorama. Each directory has the taks that were given, and steps to use my solutions.
In the end, you should able to use all of the algorithms that I wrote by using the final ```uwimg.py``` which sould encompass all what was written beforehand.
